Feature: GP-157-LookUpOtherUsers

A user will be able to go to a page (either their profile page or a new page) and search for other users. 
When they click on one of the names that were brought up they will be taken to the person's profile page and 
should be able to see their first and last name, their bio, and a list of their games if they have any.
